# Welcome to Song Recommedation Project Repository 

This is the repository containing the work done by Team 6 for SC1015 Miniproject. We have chosen to focus on the recommendation of songs to users based on what they are looking for & based on their existing playlist as well.

# Content Breakdown for Team 6 - Project Folder

1. [Dataset Folder](https://github.com/dinong1996/Song_Recommedation_Project/tree/main/Team%206%20-%20Project%20Folder/Dataset) - Contains the dataset that we have chosen for this project as well as the data description. The dataset that is the Spotify Tracks Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset is owned by Maharshi Pandya. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset

2. [Proof of Concept Folder](https://github.com/dinong1996/Song_Recommedation_Project/tree/main/Team%206%20-%20Project%20Folder/Proof%20of%20Concept) - Contains the files titled "Proof of Concept XXK.ipynb" that we have done. The aim was to see what will be difference when we use different sample sizes of 10K, 20K, 30K, 40K and 50K. Using the information from this exercise, we chose the appropriate sample size of 20K for our project as the difference in recommendation is minimized as compared to 10K and the time savings as compared to using 30K as the sample size.

3. [Reference Photos Folder](https://github.com/dinong1996/Song_Recommedation_Project/tree/main/Team%206%20-%20Project%20Folder/Reference%20Photo) - Contains the image files that we used in the Jupyter Notebook file to describe the features/methods that we have used to make the project happen.

4. [Song Recommendation Miniproject.ipynb](https://github.com/dinong1996/Song_Recommedation_Project/blob/main/Team%206%20-%20Project%20Folder/Song%20Recommendation%20Miniproject.ipynb) - Contains the song recommendation software itself. Within it, it has the Data Visualisation and Exploratory Data Analysis work done for the dataset and the Machine Learning & Prediction portion for the song recommendation software.

# Problem Statement & Aim of Project

**Problem Statement:** To create a mockup feature that can recommend new songs for users to add into their current playlist. 

**Aim:** To help listeners discover new music that they can explore and to suggest songs that align with their musical interests based on their listening history and existing playlists.

# Algorithms / Libraries used for this project

1. Pandas

2. Seaborn

3. Matplotlib.pyplot

4. Plotly.express

5. KMeans & Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

6. Count Vectorisation & Cosine Similarity

7. TfidfVectorizer

# Conclusion

1. Outcome of Project:
   - A Program that looks for 5 song recommendations based on user input
   - A Program that can recommend songs based on a given user playlist
   - Computes the song recommendations by converting song data into array object & computing the similarity between songs with cosine similarity

2. Constraints faced in the project:
   - Due to long computational time, we had to could only use at roughly 1/4 of the total dataset for recommendation 
   - Unable to find a suitably big dataset that contains the user data as well as the audio features of the songs for analysis
   
3. Future Recommendations:
   - Usage of Spotify API 
      - Get access to more user & song related data 
   - Try to reduce the time & space complexity of the program
      - To allow for the use of a bigger dataset

# Learning Outcomes

1. Collaborating using Google Collab for this project

2. Learning about Count Vectorizer and KMeans from various sources such as scikit-learn and towardsdatascience.com

3. Learning to create and plot a PCA scatter plot as well as understand what it represents from various sources such as scikit-learn and towardsdatascience.com

4. Learning how to use tokens generated by Count Vectorizer to build a song recommendation for 1 song and a list of songs 

5. Understanding how to use Cosine Similarity to calculate the similarities of different songs by using the vectors for the song

6. Learning how to use plotly.express to plot graphs to represent audio features and use it to intepret what the data means

7. Learning how to use TfidfVectorizer to convert collection of raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features from various sources such as scikit-learn
