# Welcome to Song Recommedation Project Repository 

This is the repository containing the work done by Team 6 for SC1015 Miniproject. We have chosen to focus on the recommendation of songs to users based on what they are looking for & based on their existing playlist as well.

# Problem Statement & Aim of Project

Problem Statement: To create a mockup feature that can recommend new songs for users to add into their current playlist. 

Aim: To help listeners discover new music that they can explore and to suggest songs that align with their musical interests based on their listening history and existing playlists.

# Algorithms / Libraries used for this project

1. Pandas

2. Seaborn

3. Matplotlib.pyplot

4. Plotly.express

5. KMeans & Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

6. Count Vectorisation & Cosine Similarity

# Conclusion

# Learning Outcomes

1. Collaborating using Google Collab for this project

2. Learning about Count Vectorizer, KMeans and PCA from various sources such as scikit-learn and towardsdatascience.com

3. Learning how to use vectors generated by Count Vectorizer to build a song recommendation for 1 song and a list of songs 

4. How to use Cosine Similarity to calculate the similarities of different songs by using the vectors for the song
